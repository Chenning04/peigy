=============

..  Example: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/describing-code.html
    Grammar: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/domains/python.html

This section describes the ``figures`` module of our package: make figures based on simulation results.
We reserved the word "plot" for matplotlib plots, and use "figures" as the name of module instead.

A noteworthy part is the return types: all functions in this module return matplotlib figures (``matplotlilb.figure.Figure``) rather than axes.
This is because the figures are intended to be displayed or saved directly.

.. _figures_examples:

Examples
---------

.. line-block::
    Here are some usage examples for each of the ``piegy.figures`` functions. 

    First please import the ``piegy.model`` and ``piegy.figures`` modules:

.. code-block:: python

    import piegy.model as model
    import piegy.figures as figures

.. line-block::
    All figures below are generated based on our :ref:`demo model<demo_params>`. You get a copy by ``piegy.model.get_demo`` function:

.. code-block:: python

    sim = model.demo_model()

.. line-block::
    Let's run the simulation:

.. code-block:: python

    model.run(sim)

.. line-block::
    After a simulation is completed, the first thing you probably want to do is convergence check: whether the population has reached equilibrium state.

    Make a population dynamics figure by ``piegy.figures.UV_dyna`` function:

.. code-block:: python

    UV_dyna = figures.UV_dyna(sim, interval = 10, grid = True)

.. line-block::
    ``interval = 10`` means to take average over every 10 data points. See more at :ref:`Clarifications-interval<interval>`.

    It gives the following figure:

.. figure:: images/demo_model/UV_dyna.png

    UV_dyna: Population Dynamics

.. line-block::
    You can similarly look at payoff dynamics by ``piegy.figures.pi_dyna`` function:

.. code-block:: python

    pi_dyna = figures.pi_dyna(sim, interval = 10, grid = True)

.. figure:: images/demo_model/pi_dyna_10.png

    pi_dyna: Payoff Dynamics

.. line-block::
    Note there are many fluctuations in the figure. You can smooth them out (a bit) with larger ``interval`` value:

.. code-block:: python

    fig_pi2 = figures.pi_dyna(sim, interval = 40, grid = True)

.. figure:: images/demo_model/pi_dyna_40.png

    More Smooth Payoff Dynamics 

.. line-block::
    Note the x-range has decreased to around 80: that's exactly because we are using larger ``interval`` and hence fewer points to plot.

    You can also look at change of standard deviation by ``piegy.figures.UV_std`` and ``piegy.figures.pi_std``.

|

.. line-block::
    Let's now look at distributions: the distribution of population and payoff in some certain time interval.

    To see the population distribution around the end of simulation, call ``piegy.figures.UV_heatmap``:

.. code-block:: python

    U_hmap, V_hmap = figures.UV_heatmap(sim, start = 0.95, end = 1.0)

.. line-block::
    ``start = 0.95`` and ``end = 1.0`` means we are plotting the average distribution over 95% ~ 100% of total time, i.e., the end of simulation.

.. figure:: images/demo_model/U_hmap.png

    U Distribution in 95% ~ 100% Total Time

.. figure:: images/demo_model/V_hmap.png

    V Distribution in 95% ~ 100% Total Time

.. line-block::
    Interested in some other time intervals? You can plot any time interval by changing ``start`` and ``end`` values. 

    We can also make payoff distribution heatmaps by ``piegy.figures.pi_heatmap``:

.. code-block:: python

    U_pi_hmap, V_pi_hmap = figures.pi_heatmap(sim, start = 0.95, end = 1.0)

.. figure:: images/demo_model/Upi_hmap.png

    U Payoff Distribution in 95% ~ 100% Total Time

.. figure:: images/demo_model/Vpi_hmap.png

    V Payoff Distribution in 95% ~ 100% Total Time


You may notice the correlation between population and payoff: patches with higher population tend to have higher payoff. 
Let's visualize the correlation with scatter plots. Call ``piegy.figures.UV_pi``:

.. code-block:: python

    U_corr, V_corr = figures.UV_pi(sim, alpha = 0.5, start = 0.95, end = 1.0)

.. line-block::
    ``alpha`` is used to make points semi-transparent since there are lots of overlaps.

.. figure:: images/demo_model/U_corr.png

    U Population - Payoff Correlation

.. figure:: images/demo_model/V_corr.png

    V Population - Payoff Correlation

So far we have introduced most of our ``piegy.figures`` functions and basic usages. Explore the rest as well!
